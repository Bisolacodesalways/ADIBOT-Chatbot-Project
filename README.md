# ADIBOT-Chatbot-Project
This chatbot named ADIBOT was developed using the Artificial Neural Networks and Natural Language processing alogorithm through one hot encoding by utilizing the bag of words function- a process of simulating words into numbers.
Data set was imported in JSON file and written in python dictionary format with tags, patterns and responses. important packages such as tensorflow, pickle for sterilzing, word lemmatizer. 
The data was trained 1000 times repeatedly to ensure accuracy. This project is not entirely perfect but i am still learning and developing ways to improve my machine learning prowess.
